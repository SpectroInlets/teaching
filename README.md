# EFFORTLESS MASS SPECTROSCOPY FOR ELECTROCHEMISTS

Would you prefer to concentrate on the science rather than the measurement technology?

The Spectro Inlets EC-MS is the first and only turnkey solution for mass spectrometry analysis of electrochemical reactions.

An entirely new section has been made.

Ready to perform out of the box, the system is controlled by a powerful software suite allowing the control of the  potentiostat, mass spectrometer, gas, and vacuum systems from a single integrated graphical user interface.
